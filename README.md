# Bitcoin

MRB: Mesa, Ben, and Rachel
 
1.  What research question are you trying to answer?
Our research question is: what is the relationship between Tweets and Bitcoin prices? 
In order to answer this question, we will use Twitter data to create a model that predicts Bitcoin prices, and further evaluate the model. 
 
2.  What data are you planning on using and where are you going to get the data?
We will use Twitter data, which can come in the form of tweets, trends, likes, etc. We are going to obtain the data by using an API, a Twitter developer account, and python packages such as GetOldTweets3, snscrape, TWINT, etc. 
 
3.  How much data wrangling or cleaning will be required.  Are you planning on making new features?
Since we will be using an API and we can select what data to mine, we don’t expect wrangling or cleaning our data will take much time. However, we will need to do a significant amount of work making new features and summarizing information before we fit the model.

4.  What types of EDA are you planning on doing?
We will mostly do different data visualization techniques for the Exploratory Data Analysis of this project, including plots such as scatterplots, histograms, line plots, etc. 
 
5.  What kind of machine learning model will you most likely use?
Since our response variable is continuous, we will be using supervised learning and more specifically different types of regression, starting by a linear regression model. 
 
6.  What are your anticipated results?  Do you have a hypothesis?
We anticipate that features associated with positive sentiment (such as likes) regarding Bitcoin will have a strong positive correlation with Bitcoin prices and features with negative sentiment will have a strong negative correlation with Bitcoin prices.
 
7.  Outline a plan of how everyone in the group is going to participate in this project.
